# Captain-Blottos-Game
Blottos game is a game in which there are a certain number
of battlefields, in this case 4, in which the user places
a certain number of troops in each battlefield. In this
version the user has 100 troops. An opposing player also
places his 100 troops spread throughout the battlefields.
Whoever puts more troops in a battlefield wins the field, and
the most field wins determine the winner of the game. It has 
been proven that there is no strategy to placing troops because
there is no Nash Equilibrium that can be reached between the two
players strategies. This is known as a zero-sum game. Have fun
playing against the computer!

To play, type "java Blotto" in terminal after compilation.
